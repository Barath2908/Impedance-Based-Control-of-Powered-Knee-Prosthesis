# Impedance-Based-Control-of-Powered-Knee-Prosthesis
Description:
This GitHub project showcases a versatile framework that combines precise force control with gait phase identification and analysis. We've emulated a hybrid series elastic actuator model for fine-tuned force control, implemented a Simulink Finite State Machine (FSM) model for gait phase analysis in three walking modes, and rigorously tested a wide array of classifier combinations using six ensembling techniques.

Key Features:

1. Hybrid Series Elastic Actuator Model: We've developed an emulated model for hybrid series elastic actuators to achieve precise force control and efficient energy release. This innovation is valuable for applications requiring controlled force and efficient energy management.

2. Gait Phase Identification: The project incorporates a Simulink FSM model for gait phase identification and analysis in three different walking modes, facilitating in-depth understanding of human locomotion and biomechanics.

3. Classifier Evaluation: We rigorously tested over 40 combinations of classifiers using six ensembling techniques. This extensive evaluation process provides insights into the most effective methods for classification tasks, enhancing the overall reliability of the system.
